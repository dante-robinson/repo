NOTE: sway-no-seat and sway-tiny have been dropped. Upstream has dropped
      support for running Sway with setuid root, and further upgrades
      to sway-tiny will require maintenance of a fork. Patches for the
      latter are welcome.

NOTE: Compose key tables from libX11 have been split off of xkeyboard-config
      into compose-tables. If these files are missing from your system after
      the xkeyboard-config upgrade, run
      kiss a | grep ^compose-tables | kiss a -
