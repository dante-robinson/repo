NOTE: sway-no-seat and sway-tiny have been dropped. Upstream has dropped
      support for running Sway with setuid root, and further upgrades
      to sway-tiny will require maintenance of a fork. Patches for the
      latter are welcome.

NOTE: foot has changed how it handles scaling. You may need to adjust your
      font size accordingly.
